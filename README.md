This was made for the Jumpstart Daydream workshop
I'm also submitting this to the Athena Award :3

Originally, I made this for the jumpstart daydream workshop so I could host a game jam as an organizer, but we ended up canceling it :( Nonetheless, doing this workshop was fun! I learned how to make sprites and other cool stuff. I wanted to make something cute so I decided to make a little dog platformer.

This project was made with Godot. I was able to follow along with the Jumpstart Daydream Guide to make my platformer. The guide is linked here: https://daydream.jumpstart.hackclub.com/organizer/

I really struggled with connecting the physics with the tile map and the sprites and whatnot. But, overall, I learned a lot about making sprites and game design with this workshop and mini project!
